# power-outage-analysis
### By: Jerry Wu and Ryan Doh
# Introduction
## Our data set is a set of the major power outages that occurred in the US from January 2000 to July 2016. 
## Our question is *Does the location and timing of major power outages affect the duration of the outages?*
The data set provides much information about the area, the time, and the causes of the power outages. People should care because it can provide insight into the area where someone may want to live or where they may want to buy property. It also provides insight that can help people to know when major outages are likely to occur and how long the duration of the outage may be so they can prepare for an outage and be better informed. We hope that it can provide insight into certain causes about the where and when of power outages and how that can affect the duration of the outage. There are 1534 rows and 56 columns:

### The columns we found relevant were:
1. CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED: The total customers affected by the outage
2. POPULATION: The total population of the area
3. CLIMATE.REGION: The climate region of the area 
4. U.S._STATE: The state in the US where the outage occurred
5. MONTH: The month When the outage occurred
6. CLIMATE.CATEGORY: How hot or cold the climate was during the outage
7. OUTAGE.DURATION: Time duration of the outage
8. CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED: Numbers of customers of the electric company affected by the outage
9. TOTAL.CUSTOMERS: Total number of customers of the electric company
10. POPULATION: Population of the area
11. PCT_WATER_INLAND: What percentage of water is inland in the area
12. OBS: index

# Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
### Data cleaning
First, we had to format the data frame in order to include only the columns that had information from the excel file. We did this using dataframe manipulation, setting OBS as our index and then creating OUTAGE.START and OUTAGE.RESTORATION which were stored as timestamps. We then selected the most relevant columns to our question and stored those columns in a new data frame. After this new dataframe was created, we assigned the appropriate data types for each column so that we could perform data manipulation on those columns. At the end, we added a fillna function to fill any missing values with NaN, that way we would have uniform missing values.

## Univariate Analysis
### Plot of Month
This was a Histogram plot of the months where outages had occurred, we were able to see the months where the most outages occurred. Giving us a little insight as to which months were commonly associated with power outages. Overall, the trends that we noticed were that the summer months including June, July, and August seemed to contain more outages than other months.

### Plot of Climate Region
This was a Histogram plot of the climate region where outages had occurred, we were able to see the climate region where the most outages occurred. This allowed us to make assumptions about the regions where a major outage would've been more likely to occur. Overall the trend we noticed was that the Northeast had significantly more outages compared to the rest of the regions.

## Bivariate Analysis
### Scatterplot of Total Outages in each Climate Region by Month
This was a scatter plot of the climate region where outages had occurred, we were able to see the climate region where the most outages occurred during each month. This allowed us to make assumptions about the regions where a major outage would've been more likely to occur during a particular month or group of months. The overall trend that we were noticing was that the Northeast Region typically had more outages and some of the summer months (June, July, and August) seemed to have higher averages than other months.

### Histogram of Average Outage Duration in each Climate Region
This was a Histogram plot of the average duration of each outage per climate region, during each month. This allowed us to see how long outages would last and if the month or the climate region had any affect on the average duration of the outage. The trend we noticed stemmed from the other univariate analyses where we saw that Northeast and summer months (June, July, and August) would have higher total outages. We thought that because of this, it could potentially affect the average duration of the outage. We did notice this trend in our histogram and decided to explore it.

## Aggregate data frames
### Mean of grouping by Month and Climate Region
This was a grouped dataframe based off of Month and Climate Region and the aggregate function was mean. This helped us to further analyze the average Outage duration for Summer months (June, July, and August) that were in the Northeast. (This is only the tail of the dataframe)

# Assessment of Missingness
### NMAR Analysis
OUTAGE.DURATION could be NMAR, it could be that during the power outage they didn't have the capabilites to record the duration. Therefore, the missing data occurred because someone forgot to, or was unable to (for lack of equipment or otherwise) take the time during the power outage. The data that we would like to have is whether they had equipment (or the capability) to measure time effectively from the start of the outage to the end. With this data it could change from NMAR to MAR because if we know that equipment was missing or if they had no proper way to measure it. Then we can see a direct dependence of the power outage duration being missing on the lack of equipment available or the lack of capability.

## Missingness Dependency
### Month and Climate Region
For Month and Climate Region we saw that climate region seemed to depend on Month. Whenever there was a missing value in the Month, there was also a missing value in the Climate region. We created a new column by converting the month column into a boolean column of values indicating whether it was NaN or not. Our choice of test statistic was Total Variation Distance and we found an observed test statistic of 1. We ran a permutation test, shuffling the new boolean column and calculating a TVD for each shuffle. Our observed p-value was 0, and so it was clear that the Month column had a clear effect on the Climate region.

### Climate Region and US State
For Climate Region and US State, we chose them because we saw that there seemed to be no correlation between the state and whether there were missing values or not in the Climate Region column. We created a new column by converting the Climate Region column into a boolean column of values indicating whether it was NaN or not. Our choice of test statistic was Total Variation Distance and we found an observed test statistic of .346. We ran a permutation test, shuffling the new boolean column and calculating a TVD for each shuffle. Our observed p-value was .526, and so it was clear that the US State column had no effect on whether the Climate region column had missing values or not.

# Hypothesis Testing
### *Null hypothesis*: Power outage durations are not dependent on location nor time
### *Alternative hypothesis*: Power outage durations tend to be higher in Summer, in the Northeast
Our chosen test statistic was the mean outage duration with a significance level of 5%, our resulting p-value was .148 and our conclusion was that we fail to reject the null. Our process was to first calculate the average outage duration when the duration occurs during summer months in the northeast. We then sampled from the original dataframe the same amount of outage durations that were in the summer months and northeast dataframe. We used these values to create a null distribution by calculating the average outage durations of these sampled outage durations. These choices are good because our null through this hypothesis testing is that power outages are not dependent on location nor time. If we were able to find a case where it seemed the observed statistic did not come from the null distribtuion, we would be able to reject the null and potentially find correlations betweeen location and time and average outage duration.
