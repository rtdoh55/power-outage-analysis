# power-outage-analysis
## Our data set is a set of the major power outages that occurred in the US from January 2000 to July 2016. Our question is *Where and when do major power outages tend to occur?*
The data set provides much information about the area, the time, and the causes of the power outages. People should care because it can provide insight into the area where someone may want to live or where they may want to buy property it also provides insight that can help people to know when major outages are likely to occur and so they can prepare for an outage and be better informed.There are 1534 rows, 56 columns: OBS	YEAR	MONTH	U.S._STATE	POSTAL.CODE	NERC.REGION	CLIMATE.REGION	ANOMALY.LEVEL	CLIMATE.CATEGORY	OUTAGE.START.DATE	OUTAGE.START.TIME	OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE	OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME	CAUSE.CATEGORY	CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL	HURRICANE.NAMES	OUTAGE.DURATION	DEMAND.LOSS.MW	CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED	RES.PRICE	COM.PRICE	IND.PRICETOTAL.PRICE	RES.SALES	COM.SALES	IND.SALES	TOTAL.SALES	RES.PERCEN	COM.PERCEN	IND.PERCEN	RES.CUSTOMERS	COM.CUSTOMERS	IND.CUSTOMERS	TOTAL.CUSTOMERS	RES.CUST.PCT	COM.CUST.PCT	IND.CUST.PCT	PC.REALGSP.STATE	PC.REALGSP.USA	PC.REALGSP.REL	PC.REALGSP.CHANGE	UTIL.REALGSP	TOTAL.REALGSP	UTIL.CONTRI	PI.UTIL.OFUSA	POPULATION	POPPCT_URBAN	POPPCT_UC	POPDEN_URBAN	POPDEN_UC	POPDEN_RURAL	AREAPCT_URBAN	AREAPCT_UC	PCT_LANDPCT_WATER_TOT	PCT_WATER_INLAND The columns we found relevant were CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED: The total customers affected, POPULATION: The total population of the area, CLIMATE.REGION: the climate region of the area, U.S._STATE: the state in the US where the outage occurred, MONTH: the month when the outage occurred,CLIMATE.CATEGORY: how hot or cold the climate was during the outage, OUTAGE.DURATION: Time of , CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED, TOTAL.CUSTOMERS, POPULATION, PCT_WATER_INLAND with OBS as our index
